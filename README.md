# GINQ-docs

The project provides the PDF version of [GINQ user guide](https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/master/subprojects/groovy-ginq/src/spec/doc/ginq-userguide.adoc), which could not show the code snippets online properly.

As the latest html version of [GINQ user guide](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/next/html/documentation/#_querying_collections_in_sql_like_style) could be found in the official site of Apache Groovy, so the project will be archived.
